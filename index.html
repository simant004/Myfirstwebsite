	            <p>I've honed my ability to align teams to work towards common goals. I flex to fit others' communication styles as a means to be more effective in a fast-paced environment with cross functioning teams.I deliberately like to deliver the tasks assigned to me.<br><br>

                I believe there's always something to learn, and with social media's rapid pace, there's always something new! I enjoy connecting and collaborating with new people (either in person or virtually) , that really helps in getting an insight into their views and opinions about various matters. The plethora of data sets available in the marketing field drives me to dive into the "World of Marketing".<br><br>

                Presently a student - pursuing my Bachelors in Technology from SRM INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I'm also a technology driven person from my early childhood days. I had helped in planning and executing marketing campaigns for my college fest. I had also helped in finding speakers, guest lecturers, etc. for the same. I had also assisted my team in collaborating with various food chains in and across Chennai for SRMMUN'19 and SRMMUN'20.</p><br>
